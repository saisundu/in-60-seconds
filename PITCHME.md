## Functional Programming Principles
---
### Why Functional Programming?
Offers an attractive method for exploiting parallelism for multicore and cloud computing.
### Programming Paradigms

* Imperative Programming
* Functional Programming
* Logic Programming
Orthogonal to  it:
* Object-Oriented Programming
---
### Imperative Programming 
* Modifying mutable variables
* Using assignments
* Using control structures like if-then-else, loops, break, continue, return
Most informal way to define imperative style of programming is a Sequence of instrcutions 
---
### Sclaing Up
* Pure imperative programming limited by the tendency to conceptualize the data structures word-by-word
